# Udacity

Download the udacity software from https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim  

Run Udacity first in training mode to collect data, then in autonomous mode!

Train ```cnn.py```  with ```records.zip``` (do not unzip, place in same folder) to get a trained ```cnn.pt```  
Open terminal where the drive.py and cnn.pt were downloaded, and run ```python drive.py cnn.pt```  

Tip: Increase number of epochs to 50, perhaps.
