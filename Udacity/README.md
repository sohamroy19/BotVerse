# Udacity

Download the [Udacity Self Driving Car Simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim)  

Run Udacity first in training mode to collect data, then in autonomous mode

Train [CNN.ipynb](CNN.ipynb)  with [records.zip](records.zip) (do not unzip, place in same folder) to get a trained [cnn.pt](cnn.pt)  
Open terminal where the drive.py and cnn.pt were downloaded, and run ```python drive.py cnn.pt```  

Tip: Increase number of epochs to 50, perhaps.
