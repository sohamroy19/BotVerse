Install Unity from https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download  
Install the Unity package **Barracuda** from https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/barracuda-release  
Download and extract the project from: https://www.mediafire.com/file/huysz37f6h9dntm/  
onnx generated with: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1YztWw97P0djboCqmWbuW76A-oypjfVUU  

My code file should replace ```/Assets/Stuff/EnemyChar/ShootingAiTut.cs```  
The onnx file must be placed as ```/Assets/test.onnx``` (for example)  

Implements Barracuda, so neural networks can be used in Unity Projects by exporting them as .onnx files
